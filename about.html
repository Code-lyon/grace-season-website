      <h2>About Grace Season (Gszn)</h2>
      <p>
        Gszn (Grace Season) is a Ghana-based fashion and lifestyle brand founded in 2021 by Konadu Bright and his team. 
        Inspired by biblical storytelling and reimagined through contemporary design, Gszn is a Christian brand creating waves across cities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each year, we release new collections for both men and women, offering ready-to-wear apparel, cotton essentials, 
        and lifestyle merchandise. Every piece carries a story — a blend of faith, creativity, and style across the seasons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since our official launch on 12-09-21, Grace Season has evolved to meet the demands of a new era. 
        Our growth is driven by two core pillars: innovative clothing materials and the Grace Season Networking Scheme (Sinai). 
        Together, these have positioned Gszn as a dynamic force in fashion, merging purpose with productivity.
